# 🌌 AI-Based Exoplanet Detection using TESS Light Curves

An end-to-end machine learning pipeline that analyzes **TESS (Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite)** light curves to identify **exoplanet transit candidates** and distinguish them from **false positives** using **XGBoost**.

---

## 📖 Project Overview

The discovery of exoplanets is one of the most exciting fields in modern astronomy. Space missions like **TESS** monitor the brightness of millions of stars, searching for tiny periodic dips caused by planets passing in front of their host stars.

This project automates part of that detection process by:

- Downloading TESS light curves
- Extracting transit features using the **Box Least Squares (BLS)** algorithm
- Building a labeled dataset of confirmed exoplanets and false positives
- Training an **XGBoost** classifier
- Predicting the probability that a newly observed transit signal belongs to a genuine exoplanet

---

## 🚀 Features

- Download light curves directly from the TESS archive
- Automatic preprocessing of light curves
- Transit detection using Box Least Squares (BLS)
- Feature extraction including:
  - Transit Period
  - Transit Duration
  - Transit Depth
  - BLS Signal Power
  - Flux Standard Deviation
- Binary classification using XGBoost
- Probability prediction for new candidate stars
- Dataset generation for future model training

## 📊 Dataset

The project uses publicly available data from the **NASA Exoplanet Archive**.

### Positive Class

- Confirmed TESS exoplanets

### Negative Class

- TESS False Positive (FP) objects

After feature extraction, both datasets are combined into a machine learning dataset.
